# Point-to-Point Connection Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates the physical layer of a point-to-point network connection. It implements and compares three data link layer protocols:

- **Stop and Wait**
- **Go-Back-N**
- **Selective Repeat**

The simulation evaluates each protocol's performance, particularly focusing on packet loss rates. Detailed analyses and results are available in the accompanying documentation.

## Features

- Simulation of three fundamental data link layer protocols.
- Performance evaluation with packet loss calculations for each protocol.
- Comprehensive documentation detailing the simulation setup, results, and conclusions.

## Documentation

For an in-depth understanding of each protocol, the simulation environment, and detailed performance analyses, refer to the [doc.pdf](doc.pdf) file in this repository.
